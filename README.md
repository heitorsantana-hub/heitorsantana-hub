## Heitor Reis de Santana 👨🏻‍💻

I'm 17 years old and a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at SENAI CIMATEC, with a technical background in Systems Analysis and Development. I'm passionate about programming, data, and technology, with experience in backend development, APIs, and databases through academic, personal, and freelance projects.

Curious by nature, I'm always learning — whether it's coding, exploring data-driven solutions, or building technology with real-world impact. I believe professional growth comes from continuous learning, collaboration, and stepping outside my comfort zone.
