## Heitor Reis de Santana 👨🏻‍💻

<p>I'm 17 years old, passionate about Programming and Technology, and I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. Curious by nature, I'm always looking to learn more — whether it's writing code, getting to know new cultures, or exploring ideas that take me out of my comfort zone. I believe that growing as a professional also involves experiencing the world with an open mind.</p>
